<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq">

<h3>General</h3>

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>A place for artists to publish their MLP-related music, and get in touch with their audience.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Because there is no other central repository for MLP music.</p>

<h4>Why not [INSERT SITE HERE]?</h4>
<p>Because we try to make the publishing and listening process as smooth as can be. No ads, no limits, no downsides.</p>

<h4>So how do I get on the list of artists? I wanna be one of the cool kids!</h4>
<p><a href="/register">Sign up</a> for an account. Log in, get to your user page, and upload a track, then publish it. <i>Voil&agrave;</i>, you're on the list.</p>

<h4>How do I set my avatar up?</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="http://gravatar.com/emails/">Gravatar.com</a> and create an account with the same email address as here. Upload your avatar there, it will show up here, and on other gravatar-enabled sites.</p>

<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>

<h4>Why would I want to link my YouTube account to my EqBeats account?</h4>
<p>When your YouTube account is linked, by the click of a button, we'll create a video out of your track and its cover art, upload it to your YouTube channel, and stick a direct download link in the description. 
Basically it allows you to reach both your YouTube audience and your audience here in a single upload.</p>

<h4>How do I link my YouTube account?</h4>
<p>Look for a button on your <a href="/account">account edition</a> page, as well as any of your tracks. Google will ask you to verify that you trust us. Then, you're done!</p>

<h4>How do I unlink my YouTube account?</h4>
<p>There is a button on your <a href="/account">account edition</a> page.</p>

<h3>Technical stuff</h3>

<h4>What quality or bitrate are the audio files on EqBeats?</h4>
<p>OGG Vorbis files are ~128kbps.</p>
<p>We do not re-encode MP3 files, we only update the title and artist tags. This means they are exactly the same quality as the artist's original MP3 file.</p>
<p>Your browser will stream either depending on its capabilities. 
As of today (April 19 2012), Firefox will only play OGG, Chrome can play either and will prefer OGG, and Safari and IE will only play MP3.</p>
<p>And before you ask, the cover art files are left untouched as well. We just make a few thumbnails.</p>
