<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq">

<h3>General</h3>

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>A place for artists to publish their pony music, and for the rest of us to listen.</p>

<h4>Why not [INSERT SITE HERE]?</h4>
<p>Because we try to make the publishing and listening process as smooth as can be. No ads, no limits, no downsides.</p>

<h3>Playlists</h3>

<h4>How do I add tracks to my playlist?</h4>
<p>Navigate to the page of a track you want to add, and look for an <img src="/static/icons/playlist-add.png" alt=""/> icon next to its title.</p>

<h3>Uploading</h3>

<h4>I've just updated the sound file / cover art for my track, but I still see the old one. What gives?</h4>
<p>Most likely your browser's cached the old version and assumes it hasn't changed. Try refreshing, CTRL+Shift+R, and if all else fails, close and restart your browser.</p>

<h3>Account</h3>

<h4>So how do I get on the list of artists?</h4>
<p><a href="/register">Sign up</a> for an account. Log in, get to your user page, and upload a track, then publish it. <i>Voil&agrave;</i>, you're on the list.</p>

<h4>How do I set my avatar up?</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="http://gravatar.com/emails/">Gravatar.com</a> and create an account with the same email address as the one you used here. Upload your avatar there, it will show up here, and on other gravatar-enabled sites.</p>

<h4>I've just done that but it won't show up! What do I do?</h4>
<p>Most likely your browser cached the default avatar. Try refreshing the page, or Ctrl+Shift+R if that wasn't enough.</p>

<h4>Why is my Email address publically displayed on my user page?</h4>
<p>We believe that Email is a great way to communicate, as well as an established proof of identity. We've chosen to display Email on every user's profile to make contacting artists much easier.</p>

<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>

<h4>Why would I want to link my YouTube account to my EqBeats account?</h4>
<p>Linking your YouTube account allows you to upload your tracks to YouTube directly from EqBeats.</p>
<p>Once your account is linked and you click on the YouTube upload button on one of your tracks, you'll get a chance to review what your video will look like, then a video with your cover art will be rendered and uploaded. If your track isn't published yet, the YouTube video will be unlisted, otherwise it will be public.</p>

<h4>How do I link my YouTube account?</h4>
<p>Look for a button on your <a href="/account">account edition</a> page, as well as any of your tracks. Google will ask you to verify that you trust us. Then, you're done!</p>

<h4>How do I unlink my YouTube account?</h4>
<p>There is a button on your <a href="/account">account edition</a> page.</p>

<h3>Technical stuff</h3>

<h4 id="formats">What formats do you accept?</h4>
<p>We accept most popular audio formats, but we encourage you to upload lossless files (WAV, FLAC, ALACâ€¦). The file will be transcoded to a variety of formats for convenience and compatibility, and transcoding from a lossy format to another one will always encur some quality loss.</p>

<h4>How do you process uploaded files?</h4>
<p>If the original uploaded file is an MP3, we overwrite the artist and title tags with whatever info we have. We do not process other formats.</p>
<p>The settings used for transcoding into other, more stream-friendly formats can be seen in the download dropdown. The original file is always available, for the sake of fidelity.</p>
<p>And before you ask, the original cover art files are left untouched as well. We just make two thumbnail sizes.</p>

<h4>Do you have an API?</h4>
<p><a href="/api">We do.</a></p>

<h4>Can I steal your code?</h4>
<p>Sure you can. EqBeats is licenced under the BSD-3 open source license, and has a git repository set up at <a href="https://github.com/eqbeats/eqbeats/">github.com/eqbeats/eqbeats/</a>. Any contribution is welcome, and you are encouraged to join IRC for development discussion or help with the code.</p>

<h4>Do you have other cool stuff?</h4>
<p>We have a public rsync repository of every published track as MP3 at <var>rsync://eqbeats.org/tracks/library/</var>.</p>
