<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq">

<h3>General</h3>

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>A place for artists to publish their MLP-related music, and get in touch with their audience.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Because there is no other central repository for MLP music.</p>

<h4>Why not [INSERT SITE HERE]?</h4>
<p>Because we try to make the publishing and listening process as smooth as can be. No ads, no limits, no downsides.</p>

<h3>Account</h3>

<h4>So how do I get on the list of artists? I wanna be one of the cool kids!</h4>
<p><a href="/register">Sign up</a> for an account. Log in, get to your user page, and upload a track, then publish it. <i>Voil&agrave;</i>, you're on the list.</p>

<h4>How do I set my avatar up?</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="http://gravatar.com/emails/">Gravatar.com</a> and create an account with the same email address as the one you used here. Upload your avatar there, it will show up here, and on other gravatar-enabled sites.</p>

<h4>I've just done that but it won't show up! What do I do?</h4>
<p>Most likely your browser cached the default avatar. Try refreshing the page, or Ctrl+Shift+R if that wasn't enough.</p>

<h4>Why is my Email address publically displayed on my user page?</h4>
<p>We believe that Email is a great way to communicate, as well as an established proof of identity. We've chosen to display Email on every user's profile to make contacting artist much easier.</p>

<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>

<h4>Why would I want to link my YouTube account to my EqBeats account?</h4>
<p>Linking your YouTube account allows you to upload your tracks to YouTube directly from EqBeats.</p>
<p>Once your account is linked and you click on the YouTube upload button on one of your tracks, you'll get a chance to review what your video will look like, then a video with your cover art will be rendered and uploaded. If your track isn't published yet, the YouTube video will be unlisted, otherwise it will be public.</p>

<h4>How do I link my YouTube account?</h4>
<p>Look for a button on your <a href="/account">account edition</a> page, as well as any of your tracks. Google will ask you to verify that you trust us. Then, you're done!</p>

<h4>How do I unlink my YouTube account?</h4>
<p>There is a button on your <a href="/account">account edition</a> page.</p>

<h3>Technical stuff</h3>

<h4>How do you process uploaded files?</h4>
<p>If the file uploaded by the artist was an MP3, we do not reencode it. Otherwise, an MP3 file will be made (VBR LAME preset <kbd>-V0</kbd>).
We also create OGG Vorbis files (oggenc preset <kbd>-q3</kbd>).</p>
<p>Your browser will stream either MP3 or Vorbis depending on its capabilities.</p>
<p>The original file is always available for download.</p>
<p>And before you ask, the original cover art files are left untouched as well. We just make two thumbnail sizes.</p>

<h4>Do you have an API?</h4>
<p><a href="/api">We do.</a></p>

<h4>Why is the chat so dead?</h4>
<p>Blame timezones. The chat is usually most active around 15:00 to 23:00 UTC, and even then it can be very slow some days. Try starting a discussion, or just lurk for a while.</p>
